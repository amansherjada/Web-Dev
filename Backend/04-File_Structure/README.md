# Well-organized Node.js project.

1. **public/temp**: This folder is usually for storing temporary or publicly accessible files. Files stored here could be accessed directly from the web server.

2. **src**: This is the main source directory where the core backend application code resides.

   - **controllers**: This folder contains controller files that define the logic and handling of requests for different routes or endpoints. Each controller is responsible for processing inputs, interacting with models, and sending back the appropriate responses.
   
   - **db**: This folder is typically for database configuration and setup. It might include code to connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and possibly some database utilities or schemas.

   - **middlewares**: Middleware functions are stored here. Middleware is used to process requests before they reach the controller, such as for authentication, logging, or request validation.

   - **models**: This folder contains model definitions, often representing database schemas and data structures. In an MVC framework, models are used to interact with the database and define how data should be organized.

   - **routes**: This folder holds route definitions that map URL paths to controller functions. Routes are the entry points to the backend, where specific endpoints are defined and linked to controller methods.

   - **utils**: Utility functions and helper modules are stored here. These are commonly reusable functions or classes that support various parts of the application (e.g., formatters, validators).

   - **app.js**: This file is often where the main Express app instance is created, and the middleware, routes, and configurations are applied.

   - **constants.js**: This file stores constant values, such as configuration settings, error codes, or other static data thatâ€™s used across the application.

   - **index.js**: This is typically the main entry point of the application. It initializes the server, imports the main app configuration, and listens on a specified port.

3. **.env**: This file contains environment variables, such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. It is ignored by version control to keep sensitive data secure.

4. **.gitignore**: Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git, typically including `.env` files, node modules, and other sensitive or unnecessary files.

5. **.prettierignore**: Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Prettier, a code formatter.

6. **.prettierrc**: The configuration file for Prettier, defining rules and preferences for code formatting.

7. **package-lock.json**: This file is generated automatically when dependencies are installed. It locks the versions of dependencies to ensure consistent installations across environments.

8. **package.json**: This is the main project configuration file for Node.js. It includes project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and other configuration details.
