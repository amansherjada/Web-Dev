        1. Inline Elements
        <br>
        Inline elements do not start on a new line. They only take up as much width as necessary to display their
        content, and they flow horizontally with other inline elements on the same line. They donâ€™t affect the layout of
        the entire line, and other elements can appear on either side of them.
    </p>

    <p>
        2. Block Elements
        <br>
        Block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available (by default). They stack
        vertically and are typically used to structure the larger parts of a webpage, like sections, paragraphs, or
        divisions.
