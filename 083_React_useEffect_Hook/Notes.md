# **hook**

In React, a **hook** is a special function that lets you "hook into" React's features and add extra capabilities to your functional components. Hooks allow you to use things like **state** and **lifecycle methods** (such as effects) in functional components, which were previously only available in class components.

### Why are Hooks useful?

Before hooks, you had to use **class components** to access features like state and lifecycle methods. Hooks make it easier to manage state and other features in **functional components**, which are simpler to write and understand.

### Example of common hooks:

1. **useState**: Lets you add state to your functional component.
2. **useEffect**: Lets you perform side effects like data fetching, updating the DOM, or setting up timers.
3. **useContext**: Lets you share data between components without passing props manually.

### Key points:

- **Hooks** are just functions that start with the word "use" (like `useState` or `useEffect`).
- You can only use hooks **inside functional components**.
- Hooks let you add state and other React features without writing classes.

In short, **hooks** are like special tools that give functional components superpowers!

# `useEffect`

The `useEffect` hook in React is used to handle **side effects** in functional components. Side effects include tasks like fetching data, directly updating the DOM, setting up timers, or even interacting with external APIs.

### Why do we need `useEffect`?

In class components, we used lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. In functional components, we handle these tasks using `useEffect`.

### Basic Syntax

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run the side effect goes here
}, [dependencies]);
```

- **Callback function** (`() => {}`): Contains the side effect code you want to run.
- **Dependencies array** (`[dependencies]`): List of variables that, when changed, will trigger the effect again. If empty (`[]`), the effect runs only once after the initial render.

### Simple Examples

#### 1. **Run once after initial render**
If you want to perform something only once after the component mounts (like fetching data), you use an empty dependency array `[]`.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function ExampleComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted!");

    // Example of fetching data
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => console.log(data));
  }, []); // Empty array means this effect runs only once

  return <div>Check the console for messages!</div>;
}
```

Here, the `useEffect` only runs once when the component first appears in the DOM.

#### 2. **Run on specific dependency change**
You might want to run an effect when a specific value changes, like when a user interacts with the component.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`Count changed to: ${count}`);
  }, [count]); // Only runs when 'count' changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, whenever `count` changes, the effect runs and logs the new count value.

#### 3. **Cleanup in `useEffect`**
Sometimes, you need to clean up things like timers, event listeners, or subscriptions when the component is unmounted or when the effect is triggered again. This can be achieved by returning a cleanup function.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds(prevSeconds => prevSeconds + 1);
    }, 1000);

    // Cleanup function to clear interval
    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }, []); // Empty array means this effect sets up once

  return <div>Timer: {seconds} seconds</div>;
}
```

Here, the effect sets up a timer when the component mounts. The cleanup function clears the interval when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.

### Summary of `useEffect`

- **No dependencies** (`useEffect(callback)`): Runs after every render.
- **Empty dependencies** (`useEffect(callback, [])`): Runs only once after the first render.
- **With dependencies** (`useEffect(callback, [dep1, dep2])`): Runs only when any of the dependencies change.
- **Cleanup function** (`return () => {}`): Used for cleaning up effects like clearing timers, removing listeners, etc.
