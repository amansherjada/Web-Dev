<!-- 
In HTML, IDs and classes are used to identify and style specific elements on a web page. They are attributes added to HTML elements that allow for precise selection and styling in CSS or for JavaScript interaction.

1. ID
An ID is a unique identifier for an element on a webpage.
Each element can have only one ID, and each ID must be unique on the page (no two elements can have the same ID).
IDs are often used when you want to style or manipulate one specific element.
To reference an ID in CSS or JavaScript, you use the # symbol.

2. Class
A class is a reusable identifier that can be applied to multiple elements.
Unlike IDs, you can assign the same class to multiple elements, which is useful when you want to style or manipulate several elements in the same way.
Elements can have more than one class.
To reference a class in CSS or JavaScript, you use the . (dot) symbol.
